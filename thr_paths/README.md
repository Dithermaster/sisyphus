New tracks for the Sisyphus Industries Kinetic Art Table, an amazing addition to your home which can be seen at https://sisyphus-industries.com/

In the "thr_paths" folder, browse the PNG files for generated thumbnails of the tracks, browse the JPG files for photographs of the tracks on the actual table, and download the THR files for the actual tracks. Using the table's web interface, upload the THR file to the table and then add to a playlist.

More information on custom tracks: https://sisyphus-industries.com/how-do-i-get-more-tracks-paths/

Someday when the Community section of the app is working you'll be able to access these custom tracks using that interface, but until then, you'll have to upload them manually. Note: bulk upload is possible, just multi-select the files during the upload step.

If you use my referral code when ordering your table, you will get get $75 off a metal-base side table or $100 off a metal-base coffee table. I hope you enjoy your table as much as we enjoy ours!
